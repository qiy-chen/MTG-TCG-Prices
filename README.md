# MTG-TCG-Prices

Created as a personnal learning project.
Written in Python 3

Version 0.1

Fetch the lowest price of each card of Magic: The Gathering of a list from a vendor's website (currently l'ExpÃ©dition).

## The program is divided into three main parts:

* A main user console interface

* A set of function to load and save user lists

* A set of function to request raw HTML data and to extract the relevant information.


## Instructions:

Be sure that you have Python 3, Requests and BeautifulSoup 4 installed in your computer.

1. Option 1: Your list must be named **"decklist.cdeck"** (edit the file extension) and be **in the program's root**.

  >  It must be formatted in this way: 
  >
  > Example Card Name1
  >
  > Example Card Name2
  >
  > Example Card Name3
  >
  > ...

2. Option 2: You can convert your decklist from MTG Forge (.dck). It must be named **"decklistconvert.dck"** and be **in the program's root**.

Open **MagicPricesCalculator.py** and you are ready to go!

## Limits

Being my first program manipulating HTML data, it has unfortunately some limitations.

* It calculates only the price of one unit per card (multiple instances of a card are counted as one).

* For performance reasons, it only fetches the first page of the search result.

* Only one vendor is available for now, more will be added later.

* The file opening system is rigid, requiring specific names to detect the required files.
